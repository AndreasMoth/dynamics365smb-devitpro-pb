# Analyzing Error Method Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2022_releasewave1.md](../includes/2022_releasewave1.md)]

When a user gets an error dialog while working in Business Central, a telemetry signal is emitted, which can be logged in an Application Insights resource. 

This telemetry data let's you identify and analyze calls to the ERROR method from AL code. You can also set up alerts in Azure Monitor to get notified if many users experience errors.

## Error dialog displayed

Occurs when the Error method is called and displays a dialog to the user.

### General dimensions

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|message|**Error dialog displayed: {failureReason}**|
|severityLevel|**3**|

### Custom dimensions

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|eventId|**RT0030**|
|alErrorMessage|The error string defined in error method and displayed in the client in the users language.<br><br> If the error message wasn't a text constant, you get the message `Use ERROR with a text constant to improve telemetry details` instead of the actual message.<br><br> Some messages can contain customer data. As a precaution, Business Central only emits information that's classified as [SystemMetadata](../developer/devenv-classifying-data.md). Information that belongs to other data classifications, like customer data, isn't shown. Instead, the following message is shown: "Message not shown because the NavBaseException(string, Exception, bool) constructor was used."| 
|alEnglishLanguageDiagnosticsMessage|The error string defined in error method. This dimension always shows the error message in English. This dimension was added in version 21.4.  | 
|alObjectId|Specifies the ID of the AL object.|
|alObjectType|Specifies the type of the AL object. |
|alStackTrace|Specifies the stack trace in AL.|
|clientType|Specifies the type of client that executed the SQL Statement, such as **Background** or **Web**. For a list of the client types, see [ClientType Option Type](../developer/methods-auto/clienttype/clienttype-option.md).|
|companyName|The display name of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] company that was used at time of execution |
|failureReason|**Dialog** means the error was the result of an error method call in AL. Errors thrown by the platform have other reasons, like MetadataNotFound.|

<a name="other"></a>**Common custom dimensions**

The following table explains other custom dimensions that are common to all extension update traces.

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|aadTenantId|The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant ID that's used for Azure AD authentication. For on-premises, if you aren't using Azure AD authentication, this value is **common**. |
|component|**Dynamics 365 Business Central Server**|
|componentVersion|The version number of the component that emits telemetry (see the component dimension)|
|environmentName|The name of the tenant environment. See [Managing Environments](tenant-admin-center-environments.md). This dimension isn't included for [!INCLUDE[prod_short.md](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises environments.|
|environmentType|The environment type for the tenant, such as **Production**, **Sandbox**, **Trial**. See [Environment Types](tenant-admin-center-environments.md#types-of-environments)|
|telemetrySchemaVersion|The version of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] telemetry schema|
