# Migrate to Business Central Online from Business Central On-premises

<!--Your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises solution can have an identical twin in a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online tenant. Use this twin to migrate to the cloud. The migration can be started quite easily from the assisted setup wizard in your on-premises solution.  
-->
The end-to-end process is described [here](migrate-data.md). In this article, we talk about background information and things to take into consideration.  

The migration from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises is in two separate steps:

* Data replication

  This step starts when you run the **Set up Cloud Migration** assisted setup guide in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online. At the end of the process, you have a copy of the on-premises data in the relevant environment in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online so that you can verify if the migration went well or not. The migration task has the status *Upgrade Pending* in the **Cloud Migration Management** page, and you can rerun the migration multiple times if you want to.  

  For example, you've run the assisted setup guide from a test company in a sandbox environment because you worry that many extensions might be problematic. Once the data has been replicated to the sandbox environment, you can use the troubleshooting tools in the [!INCLUDE [prodadmincenter](../developer/includes/prodadmincenter.md)], for example.
* Data upgrade

  This step starts when you choose the **Run Data Upgrade Now** action in the **Cloud Migration Management** page in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online for the specific environment.   

<!--
  > [!WARNING]
  > Depending on your specific solution, you may have to work with the upgrade tools for some time. Make sure that no one is using either the existing on-premises solution or the new online environment until the data upgrade is complete.
-->
  Once you have chosen this action, both the **Run Migration Now** and the **Run Data Upgrade Now** action can no longer be used for this company in the environment. If the upgrade has failed, an automatic point-in-time restore is run to revert the tenant to the point before upgrade. You can then fix the errors and try the upgrade again.<!--you must start over.--> Alternatively, you can start the cloud migration in another environment, or you can restore the current environment from a backup from a point in time before the data upgrade. Or, delete all companies in the current environment and start the migration again.

  If you want to migrate more companies, disable the migration, and start the setup again. Or, use the **Select Companies to Migrate** action from **Cloud Migration Management** page.

## Companies and data

The cloud migration capabilities are optimized to migrate data in batches of up to 10 companies. However, a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises or [!INCLUDE [navnow_md](../developer/includes/navnow_md.md)] database often includes more companies. In some cases, the database contains several hundred companies.  

In such cases, here are our recommendations for how to manage the migration:

* Break the migration into batches.  
* If the companies include large data sets, break the migration into smaller batches.  

    For example, you're migrating 10 companies, but two companies include 50 GB each plus 30-GB shared data. In this example, we recommend that you migrate each of the large companies individually.
* Be mindful of any extensions that might complicate the migration as described in the [Migrate data from extensions](#migrate-data-from-extensions) section.  
* Check that the company names are valid. For more information, see [Company names](migration-troubleshooting.md#company-names) in the Troubleshooting article. 
* When moving many companies, use Cloud Migration APIs.

  For more information, go to [Cloud Migration API Overview](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/cloudmigrationapi/cloud-migration-api-overview). Find samples in the [BC Tech GitHUb repo](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/CloudMigration/CloudMigrationAPIScript).  

## Migrate data from extensions

It's highly recommended that you test the impact of any extension in a sandbox environment before you install the extensions in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] production environment to help avoid any data failures or unintended consequences.  

> [!TIP]
> The migration from [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises is in two separate steps, which gives you better options to test the migration in a sandbox environment before you migrate to the final production environment.

In order to support data migration, tables and table extensions must specify if data from that table must be migrated or not. By default, the **ReplicateData** property is set to *Yes* so that, by default, any extension that is installed in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online environment will have all its tables migrated.  

In certain circumstances, you may not want to migrate all data. Here are a few examples:

* The extension is installed in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online environment but not in the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises solution

    In this case, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] will attempt to migrate the data but show a warning. Since the extension isn't installed on-premises, any table related to that extension table won't migrate, and warning notifications will appear in the cloud migration status page.

    If you own the extension, we recommend that you set the **ReplicateData** property to *No* on the extension tables. If you don't, and if you want data to migrate, install the extension in both [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online and your on-premises solution. If you don't want data to migrate, uninstall the extension from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online environment.  

* The extension references a base table

    This can cause your base table to appear empty when you view data in your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online tenant. If that happens, uninstall the extension from your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../includes/prod_short.md)] online tenant, and then run the cloud migration process again.

    Business Central will insert the default values and records into the table extensions automatically. If there any problems, you can use the **Repair Companion Table Records** action on the **Cloud Migration Management** page to insert the missing table extension records.

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Cloud Migration Management** page to verify that data migrated correctly. [!INCLUDE [bc-cloud-migrate-tableext](../includes/bc-cloud-migrate-tableext.md)]

## Data that isn't migrated

During the data migration process, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] doesn't migrate most system tables, users, and permissions.  

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, record links are not migrated because the links are associated with a user ID, and we do not migrate users from the on-premises environment to the online tenant.

### Upgrading to a new version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)]

If you upgrade to a new version of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises, including a cumulative update, then you must update the extensions as well. Depending on your on-premises solution, your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online environment contains different extensions for the cloud migration. For more information, see [Business Central Cloud Migration Extensions](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-extensions-data-replication?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/toc.json).
