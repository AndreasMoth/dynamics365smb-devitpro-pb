# Analyzing Field Monitoring Telemetry

[!INCLUDE[2020_releasewave2-17-1-later](../includes/2020_releasewave2-17-1-later.md)]

Keeping sensitive data secure and private is a core concern for most businesses. To add a layer of security, you can monitor important fields when someone changes a value. For example, you might want to know if someone changes your company's IBAN number.

To gather this data, you'll have to start field monitoring and specify the fields that you want to monitor.  For more information, see [Auditing Changes in Business Central - Monitoring Sensitive Fields](/dynamics365/business-central/across-log-changes#monitoring-sensitive-fields) in the Application help.

Telemetry is then logged for the following operations:

- When field monitoring is stopped or started
- When a field is added or removed for monitoring (only in version 18.0 and later)
- When a field value is changed  

## <a name="status"></a>Sensitive field monitor status changed

Occurs when the field monitor feature is started or stopped in the company.

|alMonitorStatus|**Yes** - the field monitor feature was started.<br /><br /> **No** the field monitor feature was stopped. This dimension is called "almonitorStatus" before version 18.0.|

<a name="other"></a>**Common custom dimensions**

The following table explains other custom dimensions that are common to all field monitoring traces. 

|Dimension|Description or value|
|---------|-----|
|aadTenantId|Specifies the Microsoft Entra tenant ID used for Microsoft Entra authentication. For on-premises, if you aren't using Microsoft Entra authentication, this value is **common**. |
|alDataClassification|**SystemMetadata**|
|component|**Dynamics 365 Business Central Server**.|
|componentVersion|Specifies the version number of the component that emits telemetry (see the component dimension.)|
|deprecatedKeys|Specifies a comma-separated list of all the keys that have been deprecated. The keys in this list are still supported but will eventually be removed in the next major release. We recommend that update any queries that use these keys to use the new key name.|
|environmentName|Specifies the name of the tenant environment. See [Managing Environments](tenant-admin-center-environments.md). This dimension isn't included for [!INCLUDE[prod_short.md](../includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises environments.|
|environmentType|Specifies the environment type for the tenant, such as **Production**, **Sandbox**, **Trial**. See [Environment Types](tenant-admin-center-environments.md#types-of-environments)|
|extensionName|Specifies the name of the base application. |
|extensionId|Specifies the ID of the base extension.|
|extensionPublisher|Specifies the publisher of the extension.|
|extensionVersion|Specifies the version of the base application.|
|telemetrySchemaVersion|Specifies the version of the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] telemetry schema.|


## <a name="changed"></a>Sensitive field value has changed

Occurs the value of a monitored field has changed in the company.
