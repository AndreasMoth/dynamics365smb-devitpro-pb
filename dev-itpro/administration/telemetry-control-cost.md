# Controlling Telemetry Cost

Azure Application Insights is billed based on the volume of telemetry data your application sends (data ingestion) and how long time you want data to be available (data retention). 

Check the Azure Application Insights documentation for up-to-date information on pricing: [https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).

## Control data ingestion cost

To reduce data ingestion cost, you can:

- sample to only ingest a percentage of the inbound data (learn more at [Sampling in Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/sampling#ingestion-sampling).
- set a daily limit of how much data can be ingested
- set alerts on cost thresholds being exceeded to get notified when it happens
- use a custom endpoint ([go to section](#use-a-custom-endpoint))

Except for using a custom endpoint, you find the options for controlling data ingestion cost in Azure Application Insights, under _configure, usage, and estimated costs_.

### Distribution of telemetry data

To see the data distribution of different event IDs in your Azure Application Insights resource, your can run the KQL queries below.

```kql
// 30 day overview of event ingestion in your Application Insights resource
let lookback = 30d ;
let traces_stats = 
traces
| where timestamp > ago(lookback) 
| extend eventId = tostring( customDimensions.eventId )
| summarize count() by eventId
| extend table_name = 'traces'
| project eventId, table_name, count_
;
let pageview_stats =
pageViews
| where timestamp > ago(lookback) 
| extend eventId = tostring( customDimensions.eventID )
| summarize count() by eventId
| extend table_name = 'pageViews'
| project eventId, table_name, count_
;
traces_stats
| union pageview_stats
| order by count_ desc
| project eventId, table_name, event_count=count_
| order by event_count desc  
```

Similarly, you can see the data distribution of different environments in your Azure Application Insights resource, by running the KQL queries below.

```kql
// 30 day overview of data ingestion by environment in your Application Insights resource
let lookback = 30d ;
union traces, pageViews
| where timestamp > ago(lookback) 
| extend aadTenantId = tostring( customDimensions.aadTenantId )
, environmentName = tostring( customDimensions.environmentName )
| summarize count() by aadTenantId, environmentName
| project aadTenantId, environmentName, count_
| order by aadTenantId, environmentName
```

### Use data collection rules (DCR)

Azure Log Analytics (the back end of Azure Application Insights) has a feature called Data Collection Rules (DCR). DCRs allow you to define rules on what is ingested into your telemetry resource. Use them to filter away unneeded telemetry data, which speeds up query performance and saves cost.

To use DCRs, your Azure Application Insights resource must be converted to Workspace-based (which enables Log Analytics as your back end). For recently created Azure Application Insights resources, Workspace-based is the default setting. For older Azure Application Insights resources, you need to convert them (takes a few minutes).

DCRs are defined on your _workspace_ under the menu item _Tables_. Business Central currently logs to two tables: _AppTraces_ and _AppPageViews_. These tables are the back-end tables for the tables _traces_ and _pageviews_ that you normally use in KQL queries. Right-click on a table and go to **Edit transformation** and select the **Transformation Editor** button to add a KQL query to filter away certain types of data.

To help you get started with setting up Data Collection Rules, we added many sample KQL queries that illustrate common filter scenarios:

- how to filter out one or more events (I don't need these events, no need to pay for them)
- how to only filter part of an event (I only want to see events when something fails or I only want 10 percent of these events)
- how to filter on Azure AD tenant (I'm an ISV and I want to start slowly on telemetry, so only enabling it for a few customers)
- how to filter on environment type (I'm an ISV and I only want data from production environments)
- how to filter on app dimensions (I'm a VAR and this app/publisher is too noisy)

For sample queries, go to [Data Collection Rule KQL samples](https://github.com/microsoft/BCTech/tree/master/samples/AppInsights/KQL/Queries/DataCollectionRules).

### Use a custom endpoint

Azure Application Insights support overriding the standard data ingestion endpoint provided in the connection string (available in the Azure Application Insights portal). This capability means you can send telemetry data to your own component to do post-processing. For example, you could filter or enrich before ingesting data into your data source of choice. The data source can be an Azure SQL database, a data lake, Azure Log Analytics, Azure Application Insights, or a third-party data store.

You can override the ingestion endpoint by using the IngestionEndpoint key in the Azure Application Insights connection string. Learn more in the documentation: [Overriding the Azure Application Insights standard connection string](/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string?tabs=net#connection-string-with-explicit-endpoint-overrides).

## Reducing data retention cost

To reduce data retention cost, you can 
- use the default retention for Application Insights resources (currently 90 days). Different retention periods can be selected for each Application Insights resource. The full set of available retention periods is 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 270, 365, 550, or 730 days.
- purge data from your Application Insights resource using a set of user-defined filters. See [Components - Purge](/rest/api/application-insights/components/purge#examples) for examples.
