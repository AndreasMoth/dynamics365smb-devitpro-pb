# Custom Help Toolkit

Microsoft has published a GitHub repository with scripts and tools that can help you prepare customized Help for your [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] solution. This Help content can then be accessed from the user interface through the *Learn more* links as described in [Configure Context-Sensitive Help](context-sensitive-help.md). You're welcome to use any tools or processes to build and deploy content; this toolkit is intended to help you in some of the steps that are required.  

[!INCLUDE [ua-toolkit-tip](../includes/ua-toolkit-tip.md)]

[!INCLUDE [ua-toolkit-onprem](../includes/ua-toolkit-onprem.md)]

[!INCLUDE [ua-toolkit-online](../includes/ua-toolkit-online.md)]

The GitHub repository includes source code for the tools, and we welcome contributions and feedback to collaborate on improving the toolkit.  

## Tools in the toolkit

[!INCLUDE [help-toolkit-deprecate](../includes/help-toolkit-deprecate.md)]

The toolkit is available at [https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365smb-custom-help](https://github.com/microsoft/dynamics365smb-custom-help). The repo contains the following tools and the source code for the tools:

- Dynamics NAV field Help conversion scripts

    For more information, see [Custom Help Toolkit: The FieldTopicTextExtractor tool](custom-help-toolkit-FieldTopicTextExtractor.md)

## Custom Help

Depending on your solution, you're expected to deploy Help to a website that can be accessed by users of your solution to supplement or replace Microsoft's content. For more information, see [User Assistance Model](../user-assistance.md) and [Configuring the Help Experience](../deployment/configure-help.md). The toolkit is especially useful if you deploy a customer-specific solution that is based on Microsoft's base application. [!INCLUDE [ua-toolkit-online](../includes/ua-toolkit-online.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Microsoft's content in the various GitHub repos is optimized for the learn.microsoft.com site and the tools that are used for this site. We encourage you to supplement our content with solution-specific content as opposed to attempting to customize our content to fit your needs. But we acknowledge that there are situations when customizations are required, and the toolkit's tools can help you achieve that.
