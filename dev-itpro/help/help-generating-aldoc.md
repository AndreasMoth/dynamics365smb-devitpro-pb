# Generating help with the ALDoc tool


This document introduces necessary steps to use `al-doc-tool ` to generate the documents for al packages.

The main steps are: 

* Clone Repo
* Install necessary reference
* Generate internal file
* Build and host project with `DocFx v2`



## Install Reference

### .Net 6.0

Our tool is based on `dotnet 48` or later(Tested version is 4.8 and 6.0) .  

You can use such command to check your local dotnet version:

```bash
dotnet --list-sdks

# will print the following message
# 3.1.426 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]
# 6.0.112 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]
# 6.0.307 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]
# 7.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]
```

You can download `dotnet 6.0` from here [Download .NET (Linux, macOS, and Windows) (microsoft.com)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

### DocFx V2

> We tested with DocFx v2 and v3, it is a pity that version 3 has not supported some functions we need. So here the version of DocFx is specified as Version 2.
>
> You can choose different way to install DocFx v2 as you like. Here is the simplest way for beginner.

Ref: [Getting Started with DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx_getting_started.html)

1. Install [Chocolatey Software | Installing Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual)

   * Run terminal as `admin`

   * Then following the steps of this page [Chocolatey Software | Installing Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual) to install chocolate. 

2. Install DocFx v2

   ```bash
   choco install docfx -y
   ```



## Generate Reference

Now we need to use our tool to generate file for `DocFx v2`.

   * Init reference repo:

     ```bash
     {Path_to_aldoc}\\aldoc.exe init -o .\\{path-to-dev-appref}\\ -v 2 -t '{path_to_package1}','{path_to_package2}',...,'{path_to_package3}'
     
     # example:
     .\\Platform-ModernDev\\out\\Debug\\aldoc\\net6.0\\aldoc.exe init -o .\\test1\\ -v 2 -t 'F:\\AL\\ALProject1\\.alpackages\\Microsoft_System Application_20.1.39764.39901.app'
     ```

   * Then generate file:

     ```bash
     {Path_to_Platform}\\Platform-ModernDev\\out\\Debug\\aldoc\\net{version}\\aldoc.exe build -o .\\{path-to-dev-appref}\\  -s {path_to_package}
     # example:
     .\\Devlopment\\aldoc.exe build -o .\\test1\\  -s 'F:\\AL\\ALProject1\\.alpackages\\Microsoft_System Application_20.1.39764.39901.app'
     ```

     

## Build and Host the Static Website

Now use `DocfxV2` to build and host website:

```bash
docfx build ./{path-to-dev-appref}/docfx.json -s
```

Wait for build completing and then you visit localhost:8080 to check.

You can also use `-p <port_num>` to change the port.



## Structure and Configuration

After you running the `DocFx v2` to initialize the reference repo, users can find under the folder {path-to-dev-appref}, there are such folders and files:
   * `./override_file`: This folder is the default folder to store the files to replace the corresponding content of the automatically generated content.
   * `./reference`: This foldler stores the mainly generated content.
   * `./template`: The template of this project, users can modify the `*.css` files inside.
   * `docfx.json`: The configure file. It is autogenerated. 
   * `index.md`: It is autogenerated,  and demonstrates the structure of this project.
   * `toc.yml`: It is autogenerated, and its file contains the `table of content(toc)`.
