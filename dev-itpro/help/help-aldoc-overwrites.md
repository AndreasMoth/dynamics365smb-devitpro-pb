# Overwriting help with the ALDoc tool

Some areas of autogenerated content are fine as they are, only showing symbolic and syntactical information, code comments, and overall application structure based on the input .app file(s). Some areas of the autogenerated content might need more information, guidance, or remarks to add extra value for the reader of the documentation. The ALDoc tool supports what is referred to as overwrites of the autogenerated articles.
