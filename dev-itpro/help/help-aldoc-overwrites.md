# Overwriting help with the ALDoc tool

Some areas of autogenerated content work as they are, showing symbolic and syntactical information, code comments, and overall application structure based on the input .app file(s). Some areas of the autogenerated content might need more information, guidance, or remarks to add extra value for the reader of the documentation. The ALDoc tool supports what is referred to as *overwrites* of the autogenerated articles. An *overwrite* is defined as a new file with content that is injected into autogenerated content.

## Checking the DocFx version

The overwrite functionality is tied to DocFx version 2. To ensure you're running the right version, check it with the following command in, for example, PowerShell.

```powershell
docfx -v
```

## Overwriting content of an autogenerated article

To get started, you'll need to inspect the `docfx.json` file to ensure that the settings are as you want them to be.

1. Go to the top folder level of the autogenerated content. For more information, see [Structure of the files](help-aldoc-generate-help.md#structure-of-the-files).
1. Locate and open the `docfx.json` file to inspect the content. Check that there is a setting similar to the following: `"overwrite": "override_file/**.md"`. 
1. Change the location folder of the overwrite file if needed, but keep the latter part `**.md`.
