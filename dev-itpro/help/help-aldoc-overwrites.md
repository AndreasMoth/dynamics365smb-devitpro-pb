# Overwriting help with the ALDoc tool

Some areas of autogenerated content work as they are, showing symbolic and syntactical information, code comments, and overall application structure based on the input .app file(s). Some areas of the autogenerated content might need more information, guidance, or remarks to add extra value for the reader of the documentation. The ALDoc tool supports what is referred to as *overwrites* of the autogenerated articles. An *overwrite* is defined as a new file with content that is injected into autogenerated content. 

> [!NOTE]  
> The overwrite functionality injects one or more sections at the top of an autogenerated topic; it doesn't overwrite that content.

## Checking the DocFx version

The overwrite functionality is tied to DocFx version 2. To ensure you're running the right version, check it with the following command in, for example, PowerShell.

```powershell
docfx -v
```

## Overwriting content of an autogenerated article

To get started, you'll need to inspect the `docfx.json` file to ensure that the settings are as you want them to be.

1. Go to the top folder level of the autogenerated content. For more information, see [Structure of the files](help-aldoc-generate-help.md#structure-of-the-files).
1. Locate and open the `docfx.json` file to inspect the content. Check that there's a setting similar to the following: `"overwrite": "override_file/**.md"`. 
1. Change the location folder of the overwrite file if needed, but keep the latter part `**.md`.
1. Save the `docfx.json` file, if you have made changes.

Next, you'll create an .md file with the content to inject as an overwrite.

1. Create a folder for overwrite files at the location specified in the `docfx.json` file.
1. In the folder, create an .md file, which will contain the injected content.  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > The relation between an autogenerated content file and the overwrite is 1:1. A best practice is to name the file according to the file it overwrites. 
1. In the folder of the autogenerated content, locate the article (.yml format) that you want to overwrite content for.
1. Copy the `uid` of that article, similar to the following format `uid: "O:Codeunit::Auto_Format"`.
1. Edit the .md file by inserting yaml metadata tags to reference the content file that you want to overwrite. For example:  
    ```yml
    ---
    uid: "O:Codeunit::Auto_Format"
    summary: Exposes functionality to format the appearance of decimal data types in fields of a table, report, or page.

    ## Introduction
    The Auto Format codeunit provides methods for formatting the appearance of decimal data types in fields on tables, reports, and pages.
    ```
1. Save the .md file when you're done.  
    The content will be injected at the beginning of the reference content.
1. Now, run the ALDoc tool with the equivalent command of:  
```bash
{Path_to_Platform}\\Platform-ModernDev\\out\\Debug\\aldoc\\net{version}\\aldoc.exe build -o .\\{path-generated-content}\\  -s {path_to_package}
```
2. Next, build the help site again with the equivalent command of:  
```bash
docfx build ./{path-to-generated-content}/docfx.json -s
```
