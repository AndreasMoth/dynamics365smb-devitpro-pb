# Security service tags

With service tags you can set up firewalls for a specific service to allow only traffic from certain services. The following table lists the IP addresses from which you can expect to receive traffic from Business Central. Use this list to set up firewalls on other systems to allow traffic only from Business Central, but not from other IP addresses.
