# Transparency note: Developer tools for copilot in Business Central  

## What is a Transparency Note? 

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who will use it, the people who will be affected by it, and the environment in which it is deployed. Creating a system that is fit for its intended purpose requires an understanding of how the technology works, what its capabilities and limitations are, and how to achieve the best performance. Microsoft’s Transparency Notes are intended to help you understand how our AI technology works, the choices system owners can make that influence system performance and behavior, and the importance of thinking about the whole system, including the technology, the people, and the environment. You can use Transparency Notes when developing or deploying your own system, or share them with the people who will use or be affected by your system.  

Microsoft’s Transparency Notes are part of a broader effort at Microsoft to put our AI Principles into practice. To find out more, see the [Microsoft AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai). 

## The basics of Developer Tools for Copilot in Business Central  

### Introduction 

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is a comprehensive business management solution for small and midsized organizations. Copilot in Business Central is the AI-powered assistant that helps boost creativity and reduce tedious tasks across lines of business, such as finance, operations and marketing. 

Customers purchase Business Central through a network of software partners, who also customize the system to their needs via mature development tools in Visual Studio Code. From the very beginning, adaptability has been one of the core tenets of Business Central, and our community of partners across the world have built their business around this, tailoring the system to individual and changing customer needs, providing solutions in virtually all industries and geographies, selling add-ons at scale through the Microsoft AppSource store. Naturally, both partners and customers expect Copilot to be as adaptable as the rest of Business Central.  


Business Central's development platform includes an extension model, the proprietary AL language in Visual Studio Code, open-sourced components and business functionality, and diverse UI and APIs in which to seamlessly add capabilities to Business Central or connect to and from external services or data sources. Developer tools for Copilot in Business Central are a native part of this same platform and are based on Azure OpenAI Service, empowering partners to implement and deploy safer, enterprise-grade, generative AI capabilities for their customers. 

These tools are intended to accelerate development, integrate seamlessly, and provide common guard rails: any capability built using these tools is still required to meet its own privacy, compliance, security and Responsible AI criteria through its own individual assessment that covers the unique use case and nuances of that capability.  

Not only does this support our partner community, but many of Microsoft’s own Copilot features in Business Central are built using these same tools.
