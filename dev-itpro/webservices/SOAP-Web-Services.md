# SOAP Web Services
SOAP web services enable full flexibility for building operation-centric services. They provide industry-standard interoperability and channel and host pluggability.  
  
You can use SOAP to interact with page or codeunit web services in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] .  

> [!NOTE]  
> Support for the SOAP protocol is being deprecated in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] and will be removed in the future. Start planning to move your solutions to use either OData or APIs pages/queries.
