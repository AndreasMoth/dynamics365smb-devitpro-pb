# Trials and Sign-ups for Business Central Online

As a reselling partner, you can invite customers and prospects to sign up for any number of Dynamics 365 apps, including [!include[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online and partner solutions based on [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)], using the same account ID. These apps will run side-by-side with each other, will use different URLs, and will be displayed as separate tiles on the *home.dynamics.com* portal.  

This means that you can show prospects a preview of what you are offering based on trials of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] and other Dynamics 365 apps.  

Adjust the onboarding checklist to fit your solution, and provide in-app tours for key experiences. For more information, see [Onboarding experiences in Business Central](../administration/onboarding-experiences.md).

## Prospects and trials

Prospects can contact you if they have signed up for the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] [free trial](/dynamics365/business-central/across-preview). This means that you can become their CSP partner. For more information, see [Connect with customers](../administration/get-started-online.md#connect-with-customers).  

Alternatively, you can create a more tailored trial environment based on the [!INCLUDE [prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] content pack on the [cdx.transform.microsoft.com](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/) site. For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments of [!INCLUDE[prod_long](../developer/includes/prod_long.md)]](../administration/demo-environment.md).  

[!INCLUDE [admin-trial-types](../includes/admin-trial-types.md)]

At any point during their trial experience, when they are ready, you can convert their trial to a paid subscription using the Partner Center dashboard. For more information, see [Converting trials to paid subscriptions](/partner-center/offer-your-customers-trials-of-microsoft-products#converting-trials-to-paid-subscriptions) in the Partner Center content.

## Prepare demo environments

As a Business Central reselling partner, you might want to have an environment that you can show prospects as part of pre-sales demonstrations. Depending on your requirements, you have several different options. For more information, see [Preparing Demonstration Environments](../administration/demo-environment.md).  

## Embed Apps and signing customers up

Specifically for partners that are in the [!INCLUDE[embedapp](../developer/includes/embedapp.md)] program, signing up customers works differently. For more information, see [Onboarding customers and creating environments](embed-app-lifecycle-services.md#onboarding-customers-and-creating-environments).
