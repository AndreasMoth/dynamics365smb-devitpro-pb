# AppSourceCop Warning AS0092
The app.json file must specify an Azure Application Insights resource.

## Description
The app.json file must specify an Azure Application Insights resource for monitoring operations related to this extension. See https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/telemetry-overview for additional information.

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)
## How to fix this diagnostic?

You can fix this diagnostic by specifying either the connection string or the instrumentation key of the Azure Application Insights resource setup to monitor the operations related to this extension.

For more information about enabling Application Insights, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](../../administration/telemetry-overview.md) and [Environment Telemetry](../../administration/tenant-admin-center-telemetry.md).

```JSON
{
    "applicationInsightsConnectionString": "<your-azure-application-insight-connection-string>"
}
```

Or before `7.2` - Business Central 2021 release wave 1 update 18.2:

```JSON
{
    "applicationInsightsKey": "<your-azure-application-insight-instrumentationKey>"
}
```

Including both of the properties will trigger a compiler error, so make sure to use only one. Using the `applicationInsightsConnectionString` property is preferred when available.

For additional information about the manifest of extensions (app.json), see [JSON Files](../devenv-json-files.md).

## Code example triggering the rule

This rule is triggered when both the 'applicationInsightsConnection' and the 'applicationInsightsKey' properties are not specified in the manifest (app.json) of the extension, or when its value is set to the empty string/GUID as shown below:

```JSON
{
    "applicationInsightsConnectionString": ""
}
```

```JSON
{
    "applicationInsightsKey": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

## Benefits of using the Application Insights

Using Application Insights provides telemetry to troubleshoot, understand, and fix issues related to your extension in production.

## Usage of Application Insights during the validation of AppSource submissions

The Azure Application Insights resource specified in the manifest of the extension submitted to AppSource will be used to log detailed information about the validation process for your AppSource submission.
