# Inherent Permissions

With inherent permissions, developers can now grant permissions to a method or event while code executes. As soon as the code execution is completed, permissions are revoked. Inherent permissions simplify the overall management and maintenance work of permission sets. With it, a specific AL method or event can get the elevated permissions necessary to finish the task at hand without getting permission errors. And it helps tighten overall security by limiting long-term user permissions and giving permissions to the code process instead.

Let’s say a salesperson wants to make a report that includes certain critical pieces of information. Behind the scenes, a method will run a query to fetch the information from the table holding the sensitive data. With inherent permissions, instead of managing permissions for that salesperson, a developer can add the permission permanently into the specific code path. This method will be granted permissions for the given object, which in this case is a table. Now, whenever an authorized person runs this method, the needed permissions are in place to complete the request.

>[!NOTE]
> For now, the `InherentPermissions` attribute is available for [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises only. It'll be added to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online in a later version. 

>[!TIP]
> It's better to use the inherent permissions for small dedicated procedures or system tasks that don't risk data exposure to users. 

## Syntax

```AL
[InherentPermissions(PermissionObjectType: PermissionObjectType, ObjectId: Integer, Permissions: Text [, InherentPermissionsScope: InherentPermissionsScope])]
```

To learn more about the syntax of the `InherentPermissions` attribute, see [InherentPermissions Attribute](../developer/attributes/devenv-inherentpermissions-attribute.md).

## Example

Let's look at a code example for the `InherentPermissions` attribute. 

```AL
[InherentPermissions
(PermissionObjectType:Table, Database:"Customers", 'r’)]

Procedure GetCustomersLocation(): CustomerLocation

```

Referring to the example explained above, let's say the report needs to show which location has more sales for the quarter. As it's not ideal to grant access to all data belonging to customers, *read* permission is granted to the method instead. It will only fetch the customer's location and leave other details (such as name, address, and so on) private.

>[!NOTE]
> Specifying `InherentPermissionsScope` is optional. To read about different types of scope, see [InherentPermissionsScope System Option](../developer/methods-auto/inherentpermissionsscope/inherentpermissionsscope-option.md).
