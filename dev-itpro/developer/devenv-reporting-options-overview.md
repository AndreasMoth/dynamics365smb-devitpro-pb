# Reporting in Business Central

Business Central offers three ways to do reporting: report objects, Power BI, and Excel. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the type of data analysis and the role of the user. In this article, we'll introduce these three methods and how they can be used differently in an organization.

Report objects are the traditional way of creating analytical reports in Business Central. They're written in AL code and can be customized by partners or developers. Report objects can display data in various formats, such as tables, charts, or matrices. They can also have filters, sorting, grouping, and totaling options. Report objects are *suitable for users who need to access specific data sets or predefined reports* within Business Central. They can also be printed or exported to PDF or Word.

Power BI is a cloud-based service that allows users to connect to Business Central data and create interactive dashboards and reports. Power BI can handle large amounts of data and perform complex calculations and transformations. Power BI also offers a variety of visualizations, such as maps, gauges, slicers, and KPIs. Power BI is suitable for users who need to *explore and analyze data across multiple sources or dimensions*, or who want to *share their insights* with others online or on mobile devices.

Excel is a familiar tool that many users already use for data analysis and reporting. Excel can connect to Business Central data using the Excel add-in or OData web services. Excel can perform calculations, formatting, filtering, sorting, and charting on the data. Excel is *suitable for users who need to manipulate or format data in a flexible way*, or who want to create custom reports or templates.

Depending on the role and the need of the user, one of these methods may be more appropriate than the others. For example, a CFO may prefer Power BI to get a high-level overview of the business performance and trends, while an accountant may prefer report objects to get detailed information on transactions and balances. A sales manager may prefer Excel to create forecasts and budgets based on historical data.

By providing these three ways of reporting, Business Central aims to democratize BI, reporting and data analysis for end-users, allowing them to be data-driven with no or little need to pay partners to achieve this.
