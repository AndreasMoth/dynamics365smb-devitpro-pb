# AL Platform Overview

This section introduces the different parts of the AL platform that are available for extension developers who want to extend the business functionality of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].

## Platform capabilities

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] comes with a rich platform of system modules and capabilities that you can leverage in your extensions. Getting familiar with the modules in the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] system application might save you a lot of time as it contains implementations of many generic tasks you might need. For more information, see [Overview of the System Application](devenv-system-application-overview.md).

Learning how to start background sessions using the task scheduler and job queues can help you offload work from UI sessions. For more information, see [Task Scheduler](devenv-task-scheduler.md).

Calling out to external web services using the HTTPClient data type. For more information, see [HttpClient Data Type](methods-auto/httpclient/httpclient-data-type.md).

Securing your app secrets with Azure Key Vault. For more information, see [Using Azure Key Vaults for Secrets](devenv-app-key-vault-overview.md)  

Instrumenting your extension using feature telemetry and custom telemetry can help you monitor the extension after it has been deployed to production. For more information, see [Creating Custom Telemetry Events](devenv-instrument-application-for-telemetry-app-insights.md).
