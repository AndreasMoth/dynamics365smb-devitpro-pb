# What is Developer Tools for Copilot?

Azure OpenAI Service offers powerful, generative AI models that our partners can now leverage to deliver a rich ecosystem of AI-powered extensions for Business Central. The Developer Tools for Copilot is a toolkit that provides AL developers a quick and convenient way to leverage the Azure OpenAI Service from AL code. Using the toolkit, developers can enhance their extensions and solutions with generative AI that's seamlessly integrated into the Business Central user experience and can be delivered as a natural part of their add-ons or customizations.

## Data governance

Azure OpenAI Service is currently available in select countries and regions. Customers and partners connecting to Azure OpenAI service within their region won't require any additional setup, configuration or consent. When connecting to Azure OpenAI service outside of the environment's region, admins must first consent to data movement across regions before any Copilot features can be used in Business Central.

From Update 23.1, environments deployed within the EU boundary won't be required to consent to data movement, but environment administrators can opt out at any time.
