# Is your offering a copilot?

At Microsoft, *copilot* refers to a category of large language model-based, generative AI interaction. A copilot empowers people to be smarter, more productive, more 
creative, and connected to the people and things around them.

An offering meets the criteria to be a copilot if the answers to all the below are 'yes'.

1. Is this an interactive, chat-based generative AI agent built on a large language model (LLM) or other state-of-the-art foundational model?
1. Does this experience respond to natural language to empower users to achieve tasks that would otherwise require substantial cognitive load or creativity, and therefore time? Examples of these tasks include helping users:

   - Generate content
   - Command product functionality
   - Provide answers and summaries
   - Provide suggestions and notifications
   - Enhance collaboration
3. If this experience will support extensibility: does it use the plugins standard for interoperabilityâ€”defined by OpenAI and used by Bing Chat, Microsoft 365 Chat, Azure OpenAIService, and others?
