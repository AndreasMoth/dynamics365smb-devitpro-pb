# Troubleshooting Client Returns Wrong CLIENTTYPE

Running, for example, the [!INCLUDE[nav_tablet](includes/nav_tablet_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[nav_phone](includes/nav_phone_md.md)] simultaneously in the same browser session will return the same `CLIENTTYPE`.

If you have implemented code that checks for the `CURRENTCLIENTTYPE`, you must run each of the different clients in separate browser windows to make sure that the correct client type is returned for each of the clients.
