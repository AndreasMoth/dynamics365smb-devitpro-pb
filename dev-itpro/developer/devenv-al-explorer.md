# AL Explorer

The **AL Explorer** provides a tool that allows you to explore, navigate, and better understand objects in extensions. You can drill down into object details, dependencies, and extension points, without looking at the code. With the **AL Explorer** you have a better overview of high-level structures of extensions that can help you specify new features, or do light troubleshooting.
The **AL Explorer** has four tabs: **Objects**, **Events**, **APIs**, and **Extensible Enums**. For each of these categories, you can apply filtering, bookmarks, go to source, and for tables, pages, and report objects, you can run these directly from the explorer window.

## View, search, and filter objects

You can get an overview of all objects in a given app scope — for example, a whole workspace or selected project — and you can search in object names, and group objects by type.

## Go to source code

For a selected object, you can quickly jump to source code, whether it's to develop, read, and understand it, or whether it's to add breakpoints as part of troubleshooting.

## Bookmarks

You can bookmark objects used frequently to easily filter a list of objects to only the bookmarked ones—for example, when navigating between those you currently work on.

## View extension points - events, APIs, and enums

To ease creating extension points and to extend existing ones, AL Explorer also allows fast overview of all events and API pages as well as extensible enums that implement interfaces.
