# Power Pages on virtual tables (preview)

[!INCLUDE[general_preview](includes/general_preview.md)]

Data virtualization is part of the fabric of the tools to integrate Business Central online with Microsoft Dataverse. To learn more about Dataverse integration, consult [Business Central & Dataverse integration](https://github.com/microsoft/d365bcdv/blob/main/Review%20of%20Business%20Central%20and%20Dataverse%20integration.pdf). Data virtualization allows users with Business Central licenses and entitlements to access data stored in Business Central online by performing (**C**reate/**R**ead/**U**pdate/**D**elete) API operations on Business Central tables that are available as virtual tables in Dataverse.  

![Diagram of the interaction between Dataverse and Business Central.](media/virtual-table-inbound-interaction.png)

These licensed users are considered as internal users to the organizations or companies that purchase the licenses. They're in employee-like relationships with the companies and perform business processes on the companies' behalf. They can access data stored in Business Central online using Power Apps and Power Automate, which operate on virtual tables in Dataverse.

Business Central 2023 release wave 1, version 23.1, introduced Power Pages on virtual tables feature. This feature allows unlicensed external users to access data stored in Business Central online by using Power Pages that operates on virtual tables in Dataverse.  For more info on internal and  external users, consult the [Dynamics 365 licensing guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544&clcid=0x409) and refer to the **Licensing requirements for external users** and **Multiplexing** sections.

External users are typically users from the customer or vendor organizations of companies that purchase Business Central licenses.  In some commerce or collaboration scenarios, these users might need to participate in processes that involve data stored in Business Central online, such as customer onboarding, vendor bidding, and so on&mdash;even if they arenâ€™t Business Central users. This new feature enables those companies to build business-to-business (B2B) portals using Power Pages that serve their customers and vendors, so external users can have anonymous and authenticated access to data stored in Business Central online.  

Anonymous access via Power Pages allows external users to perform API operations on Business Central tables without signing in. Authenticated access via Power Pages requires external users to sign in to perform API operations on Business Central tables or rows that are accessible to them. Business Central admins can select only the necessary API operations, tables, and rows to be enabled for anonymous and authenticated access by external users. Additionally, this feature also enables authenticated access via Power Pages for internal and existing Business Central users, similar to authenticated access via Power Apps and Power Automate. 

This article highlights the new feature of Power Pages on virtual tables, the prerequisites and step-by-step instructions to preview it, its current limitations, and future improvements.

   ![Screenshot of the Business Central Virtual Table app from AppSource installation.](media/virtual-table-plugin.png)

## <a name="s2s"></a>Assign permission sets to anonymous and authenticated external users

Because external users have no Business Central license or entitlements, we've created built-in app/S2S users to access data stored in Business Central online on their behalf. Permission sets can be assigned to these app/S2S users to control data access by external users.  To do so, complete the following steps:

1. In [Business Central](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/), search for and open the *Microsoft Entra Applications* page.

   There are three built-in app/S2S users:
   
   - *Dynamics 365 Business Central for Virtual Tables* for accessing data stored in Business Central online via Power Apps/Automate/Pages by personifying authenticated internal users.
   - *Power Pages Anonymous External Users* for accessing data stored in Business Central online via Power Pages on behalf of anonymous external users.
   - *Power Pages Authenticated External Users* for accessing data stored in Business Central online via Power Pages on behalf of authenticated external users.

   ![Screenshot of the Microsoft Entra Applications page in Business Central.](media/power-pages-microsoft-entra-applications.png)

1. Open the *Power Pages Anonymous External Users* card, select *Enabled* for the **State** property, and assign permission sets with the appropriate scope for anonymous external users, for example read-only for certain tables and LOGIN permission set as a minimum.

   ![Screenshot of the Power Pages Anonymous External Users card in Business Central.](media/power-pages-microsoft-entra-application-for-anonymous-access.png)

1. Open the *Power Pages Authenticated External Users* card, select *Enabled* for the **State** property, and assign permission sets with the appropriate scope for authenticated external users, for example read-write for certain tables and LOGIN permission set as a minimum.

   <!--![Screenshot](media/power-pages-microsoft-entra-application-for-authenticated-access.png)-->

## <a name="visible"></a>Make virtual Business Central tables visible on Dataverse

To make virtual Business Central tables visible on Dataverse, follow these steps:

1. In [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/), select the **Apps** section, and launch the *Business Central Configuration* app.

   ![Screenshot of the Power Apps configuration page.](media/power-apps-business-central-configuration.png)

1. In the *Business Central Configuration* app, select the **Available Tables** section, virtual Business Central tables to be made visible, such as *Customer*/*Item*/*Sales Order*/*Sales Invoice*/*Sales Shipment*/*Vendor* tables, **Edit** button, **Visible** check box, and **Save** button.

   ![Screenshot of the Business Central table configuration page in Power Apps.](media/power-apps-business-central-configuration-available-tables.png)
 
## <a name="lookup"></a>Add lookup columns on Dataverse Contact table

Because Power Pages authentication is linked to Dataverse **Contact** table, external users who sign in as contacts from customer/vendor organizations should only access their customer- or vendor-specific data.  This can be done by first adding lookup columns on Dataverse **Contact* table to the virtual Business Central *Customer*/*Vendor* tables.  To do so, follow these steps:
1. On [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/), select the **Tables** section, *Contact* table, **Columns** icon, and **+ New column** button.
1. Enter a descriptive display name for the lookup column, for example *BC Customer*/*BC Vendor*, select *Lookup* for the **Data type** property, *Customer*/*Vendor* for the **Related table** property, and the **Save** button.

   ![Screenshot of the New Column pane in Power Apps.](media/power-apps-contact-table-add-lookup-columns.png)

## <a name="synthetic"></a>Create synthetic relations for Dataverse Contact table

Since Power Pages authentication is linked to Dataverse *Contact* table, external users who sign in as contacts from customer/vendor organizations should only access their customer/vendor -specific data.  Only rows in virtual Business Central tables that are associated with the signed-in contacts should be shown.  This can be done by creating synthetic relations between the native Dataverse *Contact* table and virtual Business Central tables, such as *Sales Order*/*Sales Invoice*/*Sales Shipment* tables.  To do so, follow these steps:
1. On [Power Apps maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com/), first add lookup columns on Dataverse Contact table, see [Add lookup columns on Dataverse Contact table](#lookup) section above.
1. Select the **Tables** section, *Contact* table, **Keys** icon, and **+ New key** button.
1. Enter a descriptive display name for your key, for example *bccustomerkey*/*bcvendorkey*, select 
*BC Customer*/*BC Vendor* for the **Columns** property, and the **Save** button.  If multiple contacts are associated with one customer/vendor, you can select more columns, such as *Business Phone*/*Email*, to show only rows in virtual Business Central tables that are associated with the specific signed-in contacts.

   ![Screenshot of the Key pane in Power Apps.](media/power-apps-contact-table-add-keys.png)

1. Select the **Apps** section, and launch the *Business Central Configuration* app.

   ![Screenshot of the Power Apps configuration page.](media/power-apps-business-central-configuration.png)

1. On the *Business Central Configuration* app, select the **Table Relations** section, and **+ New** button.
1. On the **General** tab, enter the appropriate property values.  For example, to create a synthetic relation between the native Dataverse *Contact* table and virtual Business Central *Sales Order* table, enter a descriptive display name for the **Relation Name** property, for example *dyn365bc_contact2salesorder*, *contact* for the **Native Table** property, the schema name of your key for the **Native Table Key** property, for example *cr7b3_bccustomerkey*, and *dyn365bc_salesorder_v2_0* for the **Virtual Table** property.

   ![Screenshot of the Business Central Table Relations page in Power Apps.](media/power-apps-business-central-configuration-table-relations-general.png)

1. On the **Mappings** tab, enter the schema names of **Native columns** that map to those of **Virtual columns**.  For example, *cr7b3_bccustomerkey* that maps to *dyn365bc_customer_customerid*.

   ![Screenshot of the Business Central Table Relations Mappings page in Power Apps.](media/power-apps-business-central-configuration-table-relations-mappings.png)

1. Select the **Save & Close** button.

## <a name="anonymous"></a>Enable anonymous access for external users via Power Pages

To create pages for anonymous access of external users, follow these steps:

1. On [Power Pages maker portal](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/), create a new B2B portal by selecting a template from the **Templates** section, and select the **Done** button.
