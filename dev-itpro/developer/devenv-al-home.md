# AL Home

The **AL Home** page shows news related to developing in AL for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. On the right side, you have direct links to documentation on getting started with AL development.

<!-- image here -->

You can choose when to show the **AL Home** page when you start up Visual Studio Code. To define user or workspace settings, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>, and then choose **Preferences: Open Settings (UI)** for workspace settings, or choose **Preferences: Open User Settings** for user settings. Under **Extensions**, and **AL Language extension configuration**, you'll find the settings that are available for the AL Language. For more information, see [AL Language extension configuration](devenv-al-extension-configuration.md).
