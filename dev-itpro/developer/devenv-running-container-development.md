# Running a container-based development environment

[!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] is available as artifacts for running on Docker on a Windows system with Docker installed.

> [!TIP]  
> Use the `Get-BCArtifactUrl` from the BCContainerHelper PowerShell module to get the artifact URL for the version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] that you want.

## Install and configure Docker

Install Docker and configure it for Windows Containers.

1. Choose the version of Docker that is appropriate for the host operating system.

    - For Windows 10, use [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) - (option to qualify for free SKU - license may be required).
    - For Windows Server, use [Mirantis Container Runtime](https://docs.mirantis.com/mcr/23.0/overview.html) - (option to qualify for free SKU - license may be required).
    - An alternative is to use Docker Engine, which is open source and community-driven. For more information, see [Docker and Business Central](https://freddysblog.com/2021/10/30/docker-and-business-central/).
        
2. For Windows 10, switch Docker to use Windows containers. By default Docker uses Linux containers.

    To switch to Windows containers, in the Taskbar, right-click the Docker icon ![Docker](media/docker-icon.png "Docker icon"), and then select **Switch to Windows Containers**. For more information, see [Switch between Windows and Linux containers](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can run [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on Docker using Docker commands, or you can use the BCContainerHelper PowerShell module. The BCContainerHelper module removes a lot of the complexity of running Docker.

## Using Docker commands

Run **Command Prompt** as **Administrator**. In the command prompt, identify your version of Windows (example 10.0.19041.329). Run this command to pull the latest version of the generic image used to run Business Central on Docker:

```docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/businesscentral:10.0.19041.329```

Use this command to run a sandbox container with the US localization of version 16.3.14085.14363 on Docker:

```docker run -e accept_eula=Y -m 4G -e artifacturl=https://bcartifacts.azureedge.net/sandbox/16.3.14085.14363/us mcr.microsoft.com/businesscentral:10.0.19041.329```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must specify the correct Windows version in the generic image name. If your version of Windows doesn't have a corresponding generic Docker image, you might need to use Hyper-V isolation.

After starting the `docker run` command, you'll see log entries similar to the following example:

```
Initializing...
Starting Container
Hostname is b8c6941bb168
...
Container IP Address: 172.21.4.208
Container Hostname  : b8c6941bb168
Container Dns Name  : b8c6941bb168
Web Client          : https://b8c6941bb168/BC/
Admin Username      : admin
Admin Password      : Zupa5925
Dev. Server         : https://b8c6941bb168
Dev. ServerInstance : BC

Files:
http://b8c6941bb168:8080/ALLanguage.vsix
http://b8c6941bb168:8080/certificate.cer

Initialization took 66 seconds
Ready for connections!
```

At this point, you can open your browser and type in the Web client URL from the log. You're prompted to sign in with the Admin Username/Password that is shown.

> [!NOTE]  
> The container image uses a so called self-signed certificate for HTTPS communication. Because of that, your browser might warn you that the page you are requesting is unsafe. In those specific circumstances, and only for test and development environments, it is safe to ignore this warning. If you want to resolve this warning, you can install the certificate on your PC. For more information, see the link under **Files** in the log entries.

## Using the BCContainerHelper PowerShell module

To support the use of containers, optional PowerShell scripts are available, which support setup of development environments. Use the `BCContainerHelper` to work with containers. On a Windows 10, Windows Server 2016 or Windows server 2019 machine, start PowerShell as an Administrator and type:

```install-module BCContainerHelper -force```

To see which functions are available in the BCContainerHelper module use the following command:

```Write-BCContainerHelperWelcomeText```

To get started quickly, run the following command from the BCContainerHelper module:

```
$artifactUrl = Get-BcArtifactUrl -type sandbox -country us -select Latest
New-BCContainer -accept_eula -containerName mysandbox -artifactUrl $artifactUrl
```

The `BCContainerHelper` creates a folder on the C:\ drive called *bcartifacts.cache* for caching artifacts. It also creates a folder under C:\ProgramData called BCContainerHelper and places all working files underneath that folder. The C:\ProgramData\BCContainerHelper folder is shared to the container for transfer of files etc. If you don't specify a username and a password, it asks for your password and uses the current Windows username. If you specify your windows password, the container setup uses Windows Authentication integrated with the host. The `BCContainerHelper` also creates shortcuts on the desktop for the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Web client, a container prompt, and a container PowerShell prompt.

The `BCContainerHelper` module also allows you to add the `-includeCSide` switch (For Business Central versions 14 or earlier) in order to add the [!INCLUDE[d365fin_long_md](includes/d365fin_long_md.md)] Windows client and C/SIDE to the desktop and export all objects to a folder underneath C:\ProgramData\BCContainerHelper\Extensions for the object handling functions from the module to work.
