You can migrate the data that you want to take with you to the cloud. If you need more storage than the default 80 GB, you can buy additional environments or additional storage capacity. We recommend that you consider reducing the amount of data that you migrate so that it is less than 30 GB in each migration run. For example, reduce the number of companies that you are migrating data for, or delete outdated data in tables that contain log entries and archived records. Also, review [how you can manage database capacity](../../administration/tenant-admin-center-capacity.md) in a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] online environment.
