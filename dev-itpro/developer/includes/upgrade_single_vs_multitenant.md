The process for upgrading is similar for a single-tenant and multitenant deployment. However, there are some inherent differences. With a single-tenant deployment, the application code and business data are in the same database. In a multitenant deployment, application code is in a separate database (the application database) than the business data (tenant). In the procedures that follow, for a single-tenant deployment, consider references to the *application database* and *tenant database* as the same database. Steps are marked as *Single-tenant only* or *Multitenant only* where applicable.
