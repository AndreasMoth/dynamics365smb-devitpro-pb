If a deployment uses extensions that are published as runtime packages, create new versions of runtime packages against the new platform and application. Although you could run Repair-NAVapp on the extensions instead, as described later in this article, this way isn't recommended. Using Repair-NAVapp can lead to problems with the extensions after upgrade.
