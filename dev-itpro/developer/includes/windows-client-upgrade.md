Since version 14, the way user profiles are defined, stored, and customized has undergone a major overhaul. This change means user personalization and profile customizations that were done in the Windows Client are lost after upgrade. The legacy profiles remain available but their associated profile configurations are discarded. Page customizations must be either recreated using the latest Business Central client or as an AL extension. For more information about personalization, customization, and Al profiles, see:
