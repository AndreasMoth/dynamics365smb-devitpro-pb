Denotes a time ranging from 00:00:00.000 to 23:59:59.999. An undefined or blank time is specified by 0T.




[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)

The displayed text format of the time is determined by your Regional and Language Options in Windows.  
  
The following are examples of valid assignments of times to a Time variable *MyTime*. Time must be set by specifying hours, minutes, and seconds. 
  
```al
MyTime := 0T;  
MyTime := 115900T;  
Message(Format(MyTime));  
MyTime := 115934T;  
Message(Format(MyTime));  
MyTime := 115934.444T;  
Message(Format(MyTime));  
MyTime := 235900T;  
Message(Format(MyTime));  
MyTime := 030000T;  
Message(Format(MyTime));  
```  
  
The following shows what the message windows display accordingly on a computer with the regional format set to English (United States) for the syntax examples above.  
  
**11:59:00 AM**
  
**11:59:34 AM**
  
**11:59:34.444 AM**

**11:59:00 PM**
  
**3:00:00 AM**

## SQL Server

Microsoft SQL Server stores information about both date and time in columns of the DATETime type. [!INCLUDE[d365fin_md](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] uses only the time part and inserts a constant value for the date: 01-01-1754.  
  
The [!INCLUDE[d365fin_md](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] undefined time is represented by the same value as an undefined date. The undefined date is represented by the earliest valid DateTime in SQL Server, which is 01-01-1753 00:00:00:000.

## Comparing time values

Due to SQL rounding every 8 milliseconds, two identically entered times might differ in their milliseconds portion and thus would fail in an equation. 

To compare until seconds precision only, you can use a procedure similar to the CompareDateTime method from the [Type Helper codeunit](../../../../../../application/base-application/codeunit/base-application-codeunit-type-helper.md).

Alternatively, use the [Format method](../system/system-format-joker-integer-integer-method.md) to cut off the milliseconds portion, as shown in the following example:
```al
MyTime := 115900T;
MyTime2 := 115900T;
if Format(MyTime) = Format(MyTime2) then
    Message('The times are identical.');
```
