# RDLCLayout Property
> **Version**: _Available or changed with runtime version 1.0._

Sets the RDL layout that is used on a report and returns it as a data stream.

## Applies to
-   Report
-   Report Extension

[//]: # (IMPORTANT: END>DO_NOT_EDIT)


> [!NOTE]  
> Reports support both RDL and Word layout. For more information, see [DefaultLayout Property](devenv-defaultlayout-property.md).

## Remarks

The RDL file has to be in the same folder as the AL object. 

## Example

The following example shows how to use this property to generate the *MyRDLCReport.rdl* file.

```AL
pageextension 50123 MyExtension extends "Customer List"
{
    trigger OnOpenPage();
    begin
        report.Run(Report::MyRdlReport);
    end;
}

report 50123 MyRdlReport
{
    DefaultLayout = RDLC;
    RDLCLayout = 'MyRDLCReport.rdl';

}
```
