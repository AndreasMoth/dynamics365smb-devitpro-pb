## Remarks

If the **UsageCategory** is set to **None**, or if you don't specify **UsageCategory**:

- The page or report won't show up when you use the search functionality.  
- Users won't be able to bookmark a link to the page or report object from the user interface.

The **UsageCategory** is also used to categorize pages and reports shown in the role explorer of the client. The role explorer includes two actions: **Reports and Analysis** and **Administration**. Pages and reports set to **ReportsAndAnalysis** will show when the **Reports and Analysis** action is selected. Pages and reports set to **Administration** will show when the **Administration** action is selected. For more information, see [Finding Pages with the Role Explorer](/dynamics365/business-central/ui-role-explorer).

## Syntax

```AL
UsageCategory = ReportsAndAnalysis;  
```

## Dependent Properties

The [AccessByPermission property](devenv-accessbypermission-property.md) and [ApplicationArea Property](devenv-applicationarea-property.md) are optional properties, which can be applied to set restrictions on an object accessibility, when you add the **UsageCategory** property.
