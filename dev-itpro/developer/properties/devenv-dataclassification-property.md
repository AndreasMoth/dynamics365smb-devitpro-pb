## Remarks  

The data classification can be used to adhere to security, compliance, and privacy requirements and processes for collecting, storing, and using user personal information.

FlowField and FlowFilter fields are automatically set to the **SystemMetadata** data classification.  

When the **DataClassification** property is set on a table level, the fields on the table will inherit the property value. If the **DataClassification** property is set on both a table and field level, then the data classification specified on a field level will override the one from the table.
