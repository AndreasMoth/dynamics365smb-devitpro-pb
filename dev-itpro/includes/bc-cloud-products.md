You can use the built-in migration tools to migrate data to [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] online from specific product versions. The on-premises solution must use SQL Server 2016 or a later version, and the database must have compatibility level 130 or higher. Currently, you can migrate to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] online from the following products:

- Dynamics GP 2015 and later versions  
- [!INCLUDE[prod_short](prod_short.md)] on-premises  

  [!INCLUDE [bc-cloud-versions](bc-cloud-versions.md)]
