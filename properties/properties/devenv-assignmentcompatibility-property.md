# AssignmentCompatibility Property
Sets the enum to be assignable to an enum of any type. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This property provides backwards compatibility in certain cases when converting from options to enums. It should not be used for enums that are not converted from options. 
> Because the assignment is done by ordinal value without validation, there is no guarantee that the target will have a corresponding value. Special attention should be made if either source or target is marked as `extensible`.
